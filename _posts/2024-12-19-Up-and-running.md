Not ❌ my first attempt at consistent writing. Not even close. Let's just get that out of the way. It has always been one initiative after another, each to no avail. So I got thinking this time around. If (and it was a pretty big IF at the time) I could just get around to publishing my writings to a platform where people can read through (not saying they would, but can), then I would be under some sort of pressure to keep up with it, wouldn't I?

Well, that’s the plan, anyway. The code 📟 is more or less complete for the moment. I just wrapped up the fine-tuning tonight. And hey, enough rambling for now. Welcome to my blog, 'Life, Scribbled.' where I turn life’s seemingly trivial moments into something much more!
