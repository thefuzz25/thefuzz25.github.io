Not my first attempt at consistent writing. Not even close. Let's just get that out of the way. It has always been one initiative after another, each to no avail. So I got thinking this time around. If (it was a pretty big IF at the time) I could just get around to publishing my writings to a platform where people can read through (not saying they would, but can), then I'd be under pressure to keep up with it, no?

Well, that's the plan anyhow. Tried out the Jekyll framework, just got it working tonight 11-ish and hey, enough for the rambling now. Welcome to The Creative Reverie!
