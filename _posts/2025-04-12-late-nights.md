> Never thought I’d trade dawns for midnights. And for a while, everything seemed fine.

Over the past month, my routine quietly shifted later and later. This journal captures that shift — what began as a bit of late-night productivity 🛏️ turned into a blur of misplaced energy and misaligned days. And then, the course correction.

Well, this is new. 

I've always been the early riser type.

But there's something about the night's stillness that feels strangely productive.

Hey — whatever works, right? (Famous last words.)

I do seem to be getting work done but not really so.

Messed up the test today. 

Knew the answers but don't know what happened exactly. 

Just felt... foggy 😶‍🌫️.

This routine, ugh. 

I thought I could keep this up. Turns out I don't want to. 

Time to flip the script.

Note to self:

You can feel a bit off even after making the right decision. 

And that's okay.

**'The day listens to how you begin it.'**

Wise words indeed. 

So much more in control now. 

Guess I really needed the wake-up call ⏰ _(no pun intended)_.

But all for the better.

## Apr 11
Woke up even before the sun today — No clutter, no rush. 

Had time to _think_ before the day started. Wild.

As it turns out, the mornings didn't change. **I did.**

_PS: The journal entries were kept blunt and bare, because so were my thoughts at the time — quiet, scattered, and a little distant._
