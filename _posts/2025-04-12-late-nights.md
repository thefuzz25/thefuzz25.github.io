title: ðŸ¦‰ The Quiet Cost of Late Nights
---

> For a while, I didnâ€™t realize what was wrong. I just knew something felt... _off_.

Over the past month, my routine slowly shifted later and later, bit by bit. This journal captures that subtle shift â€” one that started by staying up a little late, turned disorienting, and eventually forced me to press reset.

## Mar 23
(When I first realized it was 4 a.m. and I was _still wide awake_)

Well, this is new. I've never really been a night owl before.

But hey â€” whatever works, right?

I do seem to be getting work done but not really so.

## Mar 28 
('Tis the day I went even beyond the night, and slept _after_ finishing up with the day's classes)

**'Everyday I sleep tomorrow. Even yesterday I slept today.'**

Messed up the test today. 

Knew the answers but dunno what happened. 

Just felt... foggy.

This routine, ugh. 

I thought I could keep this up, but I canâ€™t. 

Time to reset the hours.

Note to self:

One can feel a bit off after making the right decision. 

And that's okay.

**'The day listens to how you begin it.'**

Wise words indeed. 

Feeling so much more in control now. 

Guess I really needed the wake-up call _(no pun intended)_.

But all for the better.

## Apr 11
Woke up even before the sun today â€” No clutter, no rush. 

As it turns out, the mornings didn't change. **I did.**

_PS: The journal entries were kept blunt and bare, because thatâ€™s how my mind was during that phase â€” quick, cloudy, and a little distant._
