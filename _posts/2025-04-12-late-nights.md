title: ðŸ¦‰ The Quiet Cost of Late Nights
---

For a while, I didnâ€™t realize what was really wrong. I just knew something felt... _off_. Over the past month, my routine slowly shifted later and later, bit by bit. This journal captures that subtle shift â€” one that started as sleeping a little late, turned disorienting, and eventually forced me to press reset.

(When I first realized it was 4 a.m. and I was still wide awake)
Well, this is new. I've never really been a night owl before.
But hey â€” if it works, it works.

## Apr 05
I do seem to be getting work done but not really so.

## Apr 07 
(The day I went even beyond the night life, and slept after finishing up with the day's classes)

## Apr 12
Messed up the test today. 
Knew the answers but dunno what happened. 
Just felt... foggy.

## Apr 12 (contd.)
This routine, ugh. 
I thought I could keep this up, but I canâ€™t. 
It has to stop. 
Time to rewrite the hours.

## Apr 13
Note to self:
One can feel a bit off after making the right decision. 
And that's okay.

Wise words indeed. 
Feeling so much more in control now. 
Guess I really needed the wake-up call (no pun intended).
But all for the better.

## Apr 21
Woke up even before the sun today â€” No clutter, no rush. 
As it turns out, the mornings didn't change. 
I did.

_PS: The journal entries were kept blunt and bare, because thatâ€™s how my mind was during that phase â€” quick, cloudy, and a little distant._
