New Year, New Me. We all have heard that someplace or the other. But it seldom works out. In most cases, it doesn't work out. And why I know that for a fact? Because we've all _tried_ the same philosophy at some point in our lives as well.

As the year draws to a close, I find myself questioning the cycle 🔁 of setting goals that often fall short. So I thought we need to uncover what’s wrong with the ‘New Year, New Me’ philosophy. It is only then can we escape this loop and truly break free (or, in this case, make a more meaningful list of resolutions 📋 for 2025).

Here’s what I’ve figured: we aim too high and mighty. Sure it's to be achieved in a whole year i.e. 365 days worth of time. But the phrase ‘New Me’ suggests there’s something inherently wrong with who I am, like I need to erase my past and ~~reshape~~ reinvent myself into someone better. And hey, for some people, it is the case, but for the rest of us, it's just too much of an ask (and more importantly, an _unnecessary_ ask). 

So let's change things up this time around. Instead of jumping straight into resolutions, let's pause and reflect first – on both the good and the bad from the past year. Because only when we truly see ourselves as we are now, can we decide what’s worth changing and what’s worth keeping.

_PS: I'll do better than last year._ 

_PPS: Well I'll try._ 

_PPPS: I mean it's a tad difficult (because I was pretty awesome in 2024)._ 

_PPPPS: But anyhow, here I come._
