title: 💐 The Surprise of What We Feel
---

Emotions sneak up in strange ways. My sister started college this week and while I wasn’t the one packing bags 🎒 or walking into a new campus, somehow, my stomach felt a little knotted. It was almost like stage fright — which was weird, because the milestone  wasn't even mine. It left me wondering: Why was I nervous? Was it protectiveness? Was it pride? Or was it just watching her begin and realizing that beginnings always meant change for everyone. [^1]

## Why though?

> A flutter of nervousness — like butterflies, but not quite. The feeling came from elsewhere but echoed quietly within.

## Because, Family. [^2]

> We live once for ourselves, and then again, through the people we hold dear.

I ache, I hold my breath, I glow, I melt — but not always for myself. These feelings weren't mine but a borrowed reflection 🪞 of someone I love [^3], of how far we’ve both come, how far there is to go, and how in ways big and small, we’ll keep carrying pieces of each other along the way.

And maybe, that’s what we live for: to live not only our own story, but to be stitched into the stories of the people we love. To live more than once.

[^1]: Change is strange. It always feels sudden even if it’s been building for a while. Feelings, like I discovered this past week, are like that too — they don’t come one by one, they come mixed. Pride shows up with worry, excitement hides some fear, and every beginning carries a bit of an ending inside it. But that’s what makes life worth pausing for. You look back, you feel all of it at once, and you can’t help but feel grateful that you even got to live it. I could have chosen to ramble on and on in the blog but that's not the point. Me telling you what I feel was never the point. The thing that truly matters is what you feel when this blog forces you to reflect on your life and that of your loved ones. Then suddenly it all feels unbearably beautiful.

[^2]: Uhh, now that I proofread this, yes — this reads like a Fast & Furious parody. But honestly, to hell with it.

[^3]: dw Fiza, you'll do great! 🙌🏻
