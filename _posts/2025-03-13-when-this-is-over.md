title: 🤞🏻 When This is Over; A Revisit
tags: [Revisits]

There’s this poem that I came across during the pandemic. I even used a part of it in my [2020, in a Nutshell](https://thefuzz25.github.io/ian). Penned by Laura Kelly Fanucci, its essence is still worth living by. Thought I'd share.

<p style="color: var(--green-clr); text-align: center;">
When this is over

May we never again

Take for granted


A handshake with a stranger

Conversations with the neighbors

Cutely annoying cousins 

The boring Tuesdays

A crowded theatre

And life itself
</p>

<hr class="dots">
Some days, I forget. I rush through mornings, complain about professors or mess food (valid, but still), scroll past sunsets. But then I’ll talk with a friend I hadn’t seen in a while, or take a compliment from a stranger or any of the million other things — and I’ll remember.

We promised ourselves we wouldn’t forget what mattered.

Maybe it’s time to re-promise.
