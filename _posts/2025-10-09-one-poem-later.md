## The Prelude
I want to write a poem. Right now. I don't know why, it's just an impulse. So I will. And while I‚Äôm at it, why not experiment a little? In the next 1200 words, you get the rare privilege of peeking into my brain as I try and fail, gracefully, to sound poetic.

<hr class="dots">

## The Process
#### 8:23 pm
The topic: unknown. The reason: unknown. But I want to, and... no that's basically it. So let me capture live what I'm thinking as I (hopefully) churn out a melody which is (hopefully) reasonable and not a suffering for you all, my dear readers. [Chuckles] Wow, 'my dear readers' makes me sound as though I am a sixty-year-old grandpa, but anyhow. My initial thought is to write about love, but then remembered I'd have to make most of it up. Uh, what about despair? Too moody. About life? Too big. Moving on.
#### 8:31 pm
[Pauses] Wait, let me put on some music ‚Äî *Clair de Lune* on repeat should do the trick. Work your magic, Debussy! Whew, okay, I'm back. Where were we? Ah yes, the poem.
#### 8:34 pm
Why not take one of the overlooked feelings from *Inside Out*? Anxiety, perhaps? Maybe I could connect something like stage fright, which everyone can relate to, to a gesture of... nope, the Will Smith dance is all that fills my mind ‚Äî screw you, Instagram. Fear, nada? Embarrassment? Ooh, that just might work. [Knuckles crackle softly] Let's cook. Shush, dear reader, I'm thinking and I do not like the stare you're giving me, all judgy.

Why not steal one of the overlooked emotions from¬†_Inside Out_? Anxiety, maybe? I could connect it with something universal like stage fright. But no, all I can picture is Will Smith doing¬†_that_¬†dance. Screw you, Instagram. Fear? Nah. Embarrassment? Ooh, that just might work. [Knuckles crackle softly] Let‚Äôs cook. And shush, dear reader, I'm thinking and don't like the stare you're giving me, all judgy.

Two things come to mind: first, that Austin Butler quote:

> "Embarrassment is an under explored emotion. Go out and make a fool of yourself."

And second, a TED Talk I saw ages ago about... playing the fool, I think? [Surfing the web dramatically] Ah yes, Ethan Hawke. I have no clue what he rambles about for forty-five minutes, but this part stuck with me:

> ‚Äú... There is no path. There's no path till you walk it, and you have to be willing to play the fool.  
> So don't, you know, read the book that you should read; read the book you want to read. Don't listen to the music that you used to like. Take some time to listen to new music. Take some time to talk to someone you don't normally talk to.  
> I guarantee if you do that, you will feel foolish. That's the point. Play the fool.‚Äù

#### 8:51 pm
But an entire poem can‚Äôt just be a lesson. What‚Äôs the story, the emotional hook? [Five minutes of banging my head on the table] Maybe the joke‚Äôs on me. I¬†_am_¬†the fool here, fumbling to sound poetic. Let‚Äôs give it till quarter past nine before I scrap this little nuisance of an experiment.
#### 9:11 pm
What if playing the fool is as much about awkwardness as it is about embarrassment? Not a long conversation or revelation, but something impulsive, foolish, and fleeting.
#### 9:18 pm
Oh my god, I might just go for something slightly romantic after all. [Shaking of head] Like when you decide to talk to a stranger on a bus ride or while waiting for your coffee. You know the risk ‚Äî the long pause, the half-smile that makes you the most self-aware person alive. And I don't know why, but I'm picturing Chris Evans as my guy here. How would that look in a poem though? Could make it four stanzas: three in the moment, one dealing with the aftermath. Let's see.
#### 9:26 pm
For the 'now', we could work with a woman on the last metro back from the office and some stranger (cue: Evans) glancing sneakily, but obviously, before a poor attempt at speaking. She half-chuckles when he... no no no. Something's off here. I don't want it to be a fairy-tale story. I want this connection to lie in the 'almosts'. I want it to be something they could smile and shrug off at the end of the day, but at the same time smile because they felt human for trying anyway. 
#### 9:31 pm
[Stomach growls] I'm hungry.
#### 9:46 pm
How do jellyfish see? [Slap] Sorry. Back to it. Uhh, where were we? This 'thinking out loud experiment' has really scattered my train of thought. Let's start again.
#### 9:50 pm
**Step 1: The Structure**

I have no formal poetry know-how, so I'll just do what feels right purely on the basis of emotional pacing. I absolutely don't want it to be a rigid 4-4-4-4 for sure. It ought to feel scattered, hesitant. One of these might do:
- a stop-and-start 5-2-5-2, or
- a built-up 3-3-3-5, or
- a fragmented 2-3-2-3-5 or 2-4-1-4
Leaning towards the third option for now.
#### 9:58 pm
**Step 2: The Phases**

- the ambience
- first act / the setup
- the almost moment
- second act / the foolishness
- the reflection
#### 10:00 pm
**Step 3: The Characters**

- the boy ‚Äî hesitant, wannabe cool, ends up sincere
- the girl ‚Äî pretty, wannabe sophisticated, ends up wistful
This is how they look in my head. [Snaps fingers] They vaguely remind me of that¬†_Don‚Äôt Stop Believin‚Äô_¬†intro ‚Äî go listen to it, good song.

**Step 4: The Setting**

Fatigue in the air, half-empty seats and a comfortable silence. Optional: the scent of rain and metal (for solely poetic purposes). I guess we won't need nothing more than that.
#### 10:09 pm
**Step 5: The Scene**

After a lot of internal debate (it was 2 minutes tops), this is what I'm going with. The boy hums off-key to himself, lost in thought. She subconsciously hums along. Glance happens, half-smile, split-second eye contact. Both realize the absurdity and hope no one saw.

**Step 6: The Aftermath**

Later that day, the girl is setting dinner for herself and catches herself humming the song. She smiles wistfully.

#### 10:22 pm
Wow, over 1200 words that ~~you had~~ my fingers had to endure. My esteemed readers, I will not torture you with the writing and iterations of the actual poem. But since the thinking was, well, *thoroughly thought-out*, it actually didn‚Äôt take very long. [Drumroll] Here‚Äôs what rose out of this experiment. Enjoy.

## The Poem

> Half-empty seats hum with fatigue,  
> lights flicker softly, half-asleep. 
> 
> He hums to himself,  
> off-key, wandering.
> Lost inside his own world, was he.
> 
> She catches the faint thread,  
> hums along without knowing, does she.
> 
> Their eyes meet for a flicker,  
> a hush, half-smiles,
> both suddenly aware of the absurdity.
> 
> Later, she sets the dinner,  
> stirring the pasta slowly,
> the tune slipping softly from her lips,  
> a silly little song,  
> foolish, human, and hers wholly.
