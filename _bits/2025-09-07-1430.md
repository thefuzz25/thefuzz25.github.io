We often forget how powerful a routine is. A to-do list feels icy, but a plan makes the day flow — and somehow you end up getting more done than you thought. The library has helped me with this, mostly because I don’t trust my self-discipline much (I have some, I guess, so don’t take whatever I write too seriously).

Another big shift has been in how I use my free time. I’ve gone from YouTube and reels to documentaries, articles, and _Go_. (I’ll write on that newfound interest some other day.) It makes a world of difference, and half the time, you don’t even notice it happening.
