Today’s James Clear newsletter asked: 

> _Who are you afraid of disappointing, and how would your choices change if you released that fear?_

But I think the opposite. Maybe it’s the fear of disappointing that creates expectations — and I find expectations, well, quite healthy. If I released that fear, maybe I’d make bolder choices, but I’m not sure they’d be better ones. Sometimes it’s the quiet weight of expectation keeps you from drifting too far off.
