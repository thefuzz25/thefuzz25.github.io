Just when everything starts going absolutely great, doth it thunder. I finally got a diagnosis for my lower back — turns out I’m _flexion intolerant_ with a minor L4-L5 disc herniation.

- The upside: it’s still in the onset phase and can be fixed with core strengthening.
- The downside: there aren’t many core exercises one can _actually_ do in this situation. Like, what the heck. How on earth am I supposed to recover with only planks and freakin' cat-cows?

A mockery, really. To heal, I must bend without bending.
