It’s _crazy_, the feeling of betrayal is. You read about it in books, watch it in movies — but experiencing it firsthand, is another thing altogether. To know someone for so long and then realize they’ve been eating at you the whole time… I don't even know what to say.

I’d felt the dread building, and now it’s consumed me whole. Getting back up has always been doable, but this time I’m not sure I can. And that scares me.

_PS: Things like this are what prompt real change. I was always a bit cold inside and now I’m colder still._
