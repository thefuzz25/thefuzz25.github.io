I desperately want to connect with someone like me. But there’s no one even remotely close. No offence to anyone reading this, but I’m different. I don’t do small talk. I adapt myself to the person I’m with and the situation I’m in. I just want to be myself and not be alone for once. Is that too much to ask?
