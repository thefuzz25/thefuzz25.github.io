I know there’s something wrong with my left knee. There has been for three years now. But _what_ exactly is wrong, no one can figure that out. And that uncertainty gnaws at me more than the pain itself.

This is what each one of my several hospital visits have looked like:


> Me: Hi, I’m here to get my knee checked.  
> Doctor: Ah, yes. Let’s get some tests done. X-rays, MRI, bloodwork — the usual.  
> (Several hours and a small fortune later.)  
> Doctor: Nothing’s wrong, kiddo. You’re fine.  
> Me: So I can play again?  
> Doctor: No, no. Don’t do nothing more than walk. Rest and recover.  
> Me: But why?  
> Doctor: Because of the injury.  
> Me: What injury? You just said I’m fine.  
> Doctor: That you are.


And that’s that.
