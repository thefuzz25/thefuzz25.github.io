Played squash today after a long break (probably 3+ months). Just about a half an hour, and I was alone — but something about it felt electric. Maybe it’s one of the things I’ve been missing lately. I thought about it, still can’t quite place it. But it sure does hint that I shouldn’t leave sports altogether.
