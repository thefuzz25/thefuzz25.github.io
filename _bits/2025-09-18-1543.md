> “Fear is the mind-killer.” ~ Frank Herbert

The mid-semesters start two days from now, and the key thing to note is this: I’m not afraid of them this time. _I’m bored_.

Yes, yes, some of you will say that one should never fear exams. But that isn’t what I mean. I mean the air — that tension that usually hangs around a person during papers. It’s gone.
