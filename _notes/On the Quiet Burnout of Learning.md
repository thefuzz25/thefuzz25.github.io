> Knowledge went from a necessity to a superpower real quick. 🦸🏻

There was a time when we were expected to read, understand, _learn_. Now? We barely recognize things, maybe just enough to nod along. And that’s it.

This summer especially, everyone’s talking about internships, placements, careers. We've all got tabs open: 'How to crack interviews,' 'What is OOPs' and 'Top 5 skills every company looks for.'

And I’m sitting there staring blankly at the screen 💻, thinking — do any of us actually _know_ what the heck is going on?

<hr class="dots">

We’ve got access to everything. Video lectures, crash courses, cheat sheets. They're not even a Google away now. AI just hands it to you like, “Here, I got you.”

And that shift — _that change in our intent_ — is what gets to me. We’re still curious, sure. Curiosity’s human. But we’re rushed; rushed through learning, through living.

Maybe knowledge was always a superpower. We just stopped looking for it the moment it all got too easy. And that has only made things more difficult.
