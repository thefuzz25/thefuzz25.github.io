I don’t remember everything I read this past year, but I do remember a few things: a few sentences, how they felt when I read them, where I was, and the reaction they got from me. Below are ==ten sentences== that stayed with me in 2025.
## 01

> “So you could walk  
> on together to discuss  
> what bird that was in  
> the bush making the sound  
> neither of you were certain of.”

~ _Richard Langston_, Hill Walk

**Why I love it:** It sits just slightly off-center: enough to catch your attention, enough to remind you that you don’t have complete control. The poem holds human encounter very lightly, and I love the visual picture this ending stanza paints in my mind.

## 02

> “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”  

~ *Frank Herbert*, Dune

**Why I love it:** This one had to be here. Because every time it appeared in the book, it pulled me deeper into the world of *Dune*. Its power isn't in the meaning of any single line, but in the act of letting the words do their thing until fear dissociates completely.

---
## 03

> “Truth suffers from too much analysis."

~ *Frank Herbert*, Dune

**Why I love it:** Because it’s true when you think about it, false when you think too much about it, and that somehow makes it true again.

## 04

>“We all want to be remembered, I do too. I want to leave a mark. But the thing is, the marks humans leave are too often scars.”

~ *John Green*, The Fault in Our Stars

**Why I love it:** I spent much of 2025, and even before, with an underlying urge to *be noticed* or *remembered*. But whenever we do this (a) we either plan endlessly, or (b) act rashly, inevitably leaving 'scars'.

## 05

> “I swear, my dear. Sometimes our conversations remind me of a broken sword."  
> She raised an eyebrow.
> "Sharp as hell," Lightsong said, "but lacking a point.”

~ *Brandon Sanderson*, The Warbreaker

**Why I love it:** I love it because of just how polite a way it is to describe half the conversations I had in the past year. Opinions everywhere, judgement nowhere, very little point and yet everyone feels clever afterwards.

---
## 06

>“She walks lightly, old man. She walks lightly upon the earth.”

~ *John Green*, The Fault in Our Stars

**Why I love it:** Such a simple and beautiful line. It feels written in italics, even when it isn’t.

---
## 07

>"The whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key!”

~ *Fyodor Dostoyevsky*, Notes from the Underground

**Why I love it:** A piano key feels like an odd comparison at first, but it’s weirdly precise. It waits. It’s pressed. It sounds. It does the same thing again and again. It is Dostoyevsky's rejection of the idea that humans are predictable or programmable.

---
## 08

> “But he’d found that imaginary things were often the only items of real substance in people’s lives.”

~ *Brandon Sanderson*, The Warbreaker

**Why I love it:** It gives a nice weight to things that don't necessarily have any.

---
## 09

>"Kidnapping is hard work,” Denth said.  
>“Terrible business,” Tonk Fah added.  
>“It’s better if your subject never even knows they’ve been kidnapped.”

~ *Brandon Sanderson*, The Warbreaker

**Why I love it:** This conversation features here solely because of the reaction it got off me (literal chills for those wondering). I remember exactly where I was when I heard it — walking through a cool March evening, the audiobook playing in my ears — when the book seemed to pause and tilt on itself completely.

---
## 10

> “What a man can't remember doesn't exist for him.”

~ *Robert Ludlum*, Bourne Legacy

**Why I love it:** It just feels so well put. This line reduces a complicated character to a single measure of what he cannot reach. Everything else falls away.
