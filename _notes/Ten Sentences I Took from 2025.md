I don’t remember everything I read this year, but I remember a few things: a few sentences, how they felt when I read them, where I was, and the look they pulled from me.

Inspired by [Kolina Cicero](https://kolinacicero.substack.com/p/the-25-most-beautiful-sentences-i?r=6mcf3k&utm_medium=ios&shareImageVariant=overlay&triedRedirect=true), this is my list from 2025.
## 01

> “So you could walk  
> on together to discuss  
> what bird that was in  
> the bush making the sound  
> neither of you were certain of.”

The poem holds human encounter very lightly, and this ending leaves room for uncertainty without trying to resolve it. I love the visual picture this painted in my mind.
