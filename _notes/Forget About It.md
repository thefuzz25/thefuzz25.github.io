### A Little Context First

With the summer break in full effect, I’ve been, of course, using my time productively. It is, in my fifth movie of the week 🥲, *Donnie Brasco*, that I come across a throwaway line that wasn’t so throwaway.

> - If you’ve seen the movie: good.  
> - If you haven’t: go watch it, then come back. Decent movie.

But just so we are on the same page, here’s some context.

The movie '_Donnie Brasco_' follows an undercover FBI agent, played by Johnny Depp, who infiltrates the New York Mafia under the name Donnie. Over time, he ends up getting close to a low-level mobster named Lefty. The lines between duty and identity blur fast. The longer he lives the lie, the harder it gets to tell where the job ends and he begins. 

Somewhere in that murky middle, there’s this one conversation. Casual, funny, almost nonsensical on the surface. But packed with truth. It’s about a phrase — _Forget about it_. Seems dull enough, right? But the way they break it down makes you realise that language, love, logic; none of it is fixed. It’s all context. [^1]

### Context Really _Is_ Everything

A single phrase, explained with so many meanings. Agreement. Disagreement. Praise. Dismissal. Indifference. It means everything by meaning nothing on its own (if that make sense?).

That’s kind of how life works too. Because really, most things don’t come with clear labels 🏷️. No moment or feeling stands completely on its own. It’s _always_ about the context — on the situation, on the timing, on who’s involved.

Take these for example,

- Did you ever get a reply that was a simple '🅺,' and suddenly you're trying to read between the lines — like was it just a quick reply or a dismissal? I’ve had a friend text me this single letter, and I thought they were mad. Turned out, not mad, just busy. And I nearly overthought the whole thing.
- There’s this moment in every group hangout where the conversation dies down. And most of the times, we interpret the silence as _awkward_. I’ve felt that tension too, only to realise that at times everyone is just comfortable enough not to speak. 

Context changes how we feel about the exact same scenario.

### And Sometimes, It _Is_ the Only Thing

Such phrases aren’t just about brushing things off. They're a reminder that meaning is slippery.  Life’s a conversation full of timing, inflection, and interruptions. So the next time it throws something right at you — good or bad; just smile, shake your head, and say… 
> _"eh, Forget about it."_
