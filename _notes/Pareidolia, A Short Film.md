## How It Came to Be

#### Apr 2024

The summer of ’24 arrived with me back home after ~~surviving~~ acing my freshman year of college. My sister had just finished 11th grade. Between the two of us, there was a surplus of time, confidence, and very little sense of consequence. 🤷🏻‍♂️

We decided to make something creative.

FYI: We come from a family of artists, so starting wasn’t the problem. Following through usually was.

#### May 2024

After about two weeks of thinking about making that *something* (and feeling productive because of it), I finally wrote a script and sketched a storyboard. The film was to be about 'creative block' and how one eventually overcomes it in the unlikeliest of moments.

To keep things practical, we limited ourselves to the house 🏠 and garden 🪴.
Our entire production setup consisted of a Canon 7D, an iPhone SE and two IKEA study lamps. The lamps, it ought to be mentioned, showed up every day and asked for nothing in return.

#### June 2024

Shooting was exhausting. Between set design, direction, lighting (and convincing my sister for yet another reshoot), time flew right past. A lot many *'one more takes'* later, we sort of finally had what we needed.

All that done and dusted, I opened Final Cut Pro and imported roughly 50 GB of footage. I stared at it for a while. The screen stared back. Apart from basic sequencing of the clips, I couldn't figure out head or tail of the software. So I closed the project and did what any reasonable person would do: nothing. 🎉

[One and a half year later]

#### Oct 2025

Panic, it turns out, is an excellent creative motivator. I resumed editing the film, not because I fancied it, but because my sister’s 18th birthday was approaching and I hadn’t sent a gift yet 😬.

A friend suggested editing to music. I began searching for a song that changed moods dramatically, covered multiple genres, and could carry an unfinished film through sheer force of personality. Something in the _Bohemian Rhapsody_ family tree. *Cue:* days of searching (and an unreasonable amount of overthinking); I landed on _Live and Let Die_ by Beatles' bassist Paul McCartney 👨🏻‍🎤. It worked absurdly well.

The edit came together just in time.

And that’s how _Pareidolia_ ☁️ came to be: a film named after the tendency to find meaning in randomness: faces in clouds, shapes in shadows, and trust in a project that took about a couple years to finish (mostly by accident).
