This was, of course, an Olympics year, and the Paris Games gave the world something to unite over (and make memes about)... if only for a few fleeting weeks (the unity, not the memes).

#### The Yin and Yang of Sharp shooting

The first of the moments came from the sharp shooting event where South Korea’s Kim Yeji and Turkey’s Yusuf Dikeç each went viral for their contrasting styles; she was laser focused and looked like someone from *The Matrix* (do NOT get on the her wrong side), while he looked impossibly relaxed with his hand in his pocket, as if he’d wandered into the competition itself by mistake. 

> It is even whispered in the lores of ol' that Dikeç claimed the silver medal 🥈 solely to complement his silver-streaked hair. 

_PS:_ His stance is now a victory symbol for atheletes worldwide — being used by Kieron Pollard, Mondo Duplantis, Nina Kennedy and İrfan Can.

#### Hopping her Way into History (More like Jumping into a Well, but okay)

One other Olympic standout (and NOT in a good way this time) was the Australian breakdancer Raygun, who kangaroo-hopped 🦘 her way into internet history with a woeful performance in the sport’s debut appearance at the Games. Dressed like a dorky cricket player (with her shirt tucked into her pants, no less), she rolled around on the floor in a series of movements that earned her exactly zero points but caused her to go viral online. Controversy followed, about how she ended up representing her country at the Games in the first place; before she announched her retirement later in the year.

#### An Ode to Vinesh Phogat

Imagine training your whole life for an Olympic win, only to be over the weight limit on the morning of the big match 🤼‍♀️, that too by just a *100 grams*. That’s exactly what happened to India’s Vinesh Phogat at the Paris 2024 Olympics. All possible drastic measures, including cutting off her hair, were used. However, she was still not below her allowed weight. Disqualified and denied her appeal for a joint-silver medal, she decided to call it quits and announced her retirement the very next day.

#### Some other Stories from the Games

Swimmer 🏊🏻‍♀️ Katie Ledecky became the most successful female Olympian in U.S. history and gymnast 🤸🏾‍♀️ Simone Biles made a fabulous return with 3 golds and 1 silver, after withdrawing midway through the Games in 2021 to prioritise her mental health. And there was also the triumphant story of athletes 🏃🏼 Hunter Woodhall and Tara Davis-Woodhall, the married couple taking home golds and capturing our hearts.[^1]
