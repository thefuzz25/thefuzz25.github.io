### Progress Doesn't Take Breaks

While AI remains in the spotlight 💡 of innovation, the honeymoon of everyone asking ChatGPT to write clever poems or instagram captions is over. 

We have reached the stage where ChatGPT and AI have now become a *verb* like 'Google'. The former is now used by 200 million people every week, up from 100 million over the same period a year ago, according to OpenAl.

And its not just OpenAI's ChatGPT now. There's Google's Gemini (bye bye Bard), Meta's Llama, ~~Twitter's~~ X's Grok (can't help it, Twitter still comes out more naturally) and Microsoft's Copilot, just to name a few.

But beyond the headlines and the product names, the real story this year was about how AI moved from being an experiment to infrastructure. These tools became more than technology. They became cornerstones in creativity, productivity, and possibility. This year saw plenty of ambitious ideas, intriguing gadgets, and breakthrough medical treatments.

### The New Normal

This year, nearly two-thirds of industries adopted Generative AI not as a side project, but as a serious investment. This is no longer about experimenting but about committing. From streamlining workflows to designing better customer experiences, they counted on AI to achieve more with less.

And it paid off. Big time. 

For every $1 companies invested in AI, they earned back $3.70 in value. The top-performing companies? They made over $10 for every dollar spent.

It’s not just cost-cutting. It’s capability expansion. Faster decisions. More personalized services. And in many cases, entirely new business models. Let's see where it all ends up.

### Breakthroughs in Science

Industries aside, AI became a real force in science. Google’s AlphaFold 3 🧬 helped scientists understand how proteins, DNA, and other tiny molecules interact; which is a big step forward for medicine and drug discovery. Instead of spending years in the lab, researchers can now test ideas in hours using AI.

AI also designed new medicines 💉, some of which are now being tested in real patients. In neuroscience, researchers at UC Berkeley developed non-invasive AI models could turn brain signals into rough images of what people were looking at: a glimpse into the future of brain-tech. Scientists even used AI to discover new materials and spot unknown microbes in nature.

### Glasses are the Next Big Thing

2024 also gave us a glimpse of what comes after smartphones. The tech world has been quietly (and not-so-quietly) betting on spatial computing where digital interfaces blend more naturally into our physical environment. But for some, they can also be restrictive.

And that’s where their lighter, more (um) wearable cousins come in: smart glasses 😎.

Think Ray-Bans that can take photos, transcribe conversations, or display turn-by-turn directions in your field of view. They don’t transport you to a different world, they enhance the one you’re already in. While we’re not fully there yet, but it’s clear: the screen is shifting from our hands to our eyes.

The only question now is: are we adapting fast enough to keep up? [^1]
