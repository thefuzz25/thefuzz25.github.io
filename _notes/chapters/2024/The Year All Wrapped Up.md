Hey kid,

Look, I don’t know what version of the internet you’re running this on 📟. I know reading hurts your brain.  I know you’ve got the stats. You’ve got the timeline. What you don’t have is the vibe. So let me help you out.

I’m writing from 2024: an year where nothing made sense, but everything kept happening. Read ahead.

Madonna drew 1.6 million fans to a free beach concert in Brazil. Taylor Swift 🎤 basically ran the economy with a tour that made enough to fix a small country, while Nolan’s Oppenheimer swept the Oscars, a three-hour movie about nukes and white guilt. Congrats, cinema.

Meanwhile, Gaza was still on fire. Iran lobbed drones at Israel. Sudan threw their hat in. Syria? Assad finally got booted after 13 years of war no one thought would end. Ukraine and Russia kept going at each other past day 1,000. People died and supply chains cried. All of it quietly horrifying, but we kept scrolling.

And then there were the elections 📨. Biden blew a debate so badly it retired him. Kamala stepped in, made history, lost anyway. Trump won. Again. As a convicted felon. Modi won. Again. Not a convicted felon. That's better, I guess. Elon Musk moonwalked past $400 billion. AI didn’t take over the world (yet), but it did take over our phones, our resumes, our break-up texts.

Oh, and Australia banned social media for kids. Cute. South Africa’s ruling party finally lost its grip. Mexico swore in its first female president. India won the T20 World Cup 🏏. Simone Biles pulled off a comeback at the Paris Olympics, and Katie Ledecky became the most decorated female Olympian (of our times). And a guy paid $6 million for a banana taped to a wall. We don't know why. Maybe you do.

#### So yeah, 2024 happened.

It's your job to make sense of all this. You probably won’t, but good luck trying. Now go write your paper. And for the love of humanity, don’t let AI write it for you.
