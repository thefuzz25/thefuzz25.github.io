The Oxford Word of the Year for 2024 was **'brain rot.'** It basically means what your brain feels like when it's turning to mush: usually because you've been watching or scrolling through too much content that's silly, pointless, or just not doing much for your mind.

But enough about *Deadpool & Wolverine.*

Still, some of it made us laugh. Some of it made no sense. And some of it, weirdly enough, brought people together. So with that in mind, here’s a look back at the memes that defined 2024 both online and off.

#### The Rizzler

Where else to even begin? The king. The myth. The rizzler. This tiny internet legend strutted into our feeds dressed as Black Panther and never left. His viral debut came courtesy of his dad, who shared a clip of him in costume. That’s all it took. The internet crowned him *The Rizzler*, and suddenly, he was everywhere. His confidence, charm, and adorable sass gave many Gen Z'ers big sibling energy.  And yes, he’s now releasing music too.

#### Kamala Coconut

> “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree 🥥?” ~ Kamala Harris, the then U.S. Vice President

What does it mean? What is the context? What are the words that come before or after her saying that? We may never know. And that is the joy of the meme.

#### Aha Tamatar Bade Mazedaar

A cute song *‘Aha tamatar bade mazedaar’* which showcases an animated video of a cat dancing to this song went viral in the summer. It was originally a children's rhyme which grabbed attention on social media after users began to incorporate the audio into their posts.

#### Chin Tapak Dum Dum

This popular catchphrase from Chhota Bheem, famously used by the villain Takia for his mischievous antics, caught traction online as well. Social media users have creatively turned it into a meme template to humorously depict overcoming life’s minor challenges and become a symbol of everyday wins.

#### Ek Machhali Paani Mein Gayi, Chappak

What started as a chaotic party game quickly became a viral trend. The game’s rules are simple yet chaotic: players sit in a circle and chant, “Ek machhali paani mein gayi, chhappak,” adding more *machhalis* 🐟 and more *chhappaks*  💦 in each round. One wrong move, and you're out. The game spread like wildfire, with people posting increasingly ridiculous and fast-paced versions. It brought joy, confusion, and a lot of tongue-twisters.

#### Chill Guy

Sometimes, all a meme needs is a vibe. Enter: **Chill Guy**. A dog wearing jeans, sneakers, and a sweater; smirking like he knows something we don’t. He’s not trying too hard. He’s not fazed. He’s just chill. The meme became a shorthand for low-stress living and casual confidence. Chill Guy showed up in everything from office fails to college deadlines, and brought peace wherever he went.

#### Spotify Wrapped

As always, December brought the annual digital confessional by Spotify. But this year, Wrapped wasn’t just a playlist — it was a personality quiz, a dating profile, a meme template, and a brutal mirror. People shared their music tastes with pride (and sometimes horror), while others got creative with fake Wrapped stats like:

- You spend 80,467 minutes this year thinking she liked you back, or 
- Most played this year: you lol. 

Spotify Wrapped remained one of the internet’s favorite communal rituals.

From cats singing about tomatoes to a dog in sneakers who became our emotional role model, 2024’s memes reminded us not to take things too seriously. Things are burning down around us, wars are being raged, the economy continues to fall, politics has left folks more divided than ever before, education is collapsing, we’re more lonely than ever before. So much is going wrong and yet, we tuck our hands into our pockets, put a silly little smirk on our face, and brave the next day. Because we’re all chill guys and gals 😎 who don’t give a damn.[^1]
