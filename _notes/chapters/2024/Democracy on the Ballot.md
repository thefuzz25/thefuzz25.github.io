> "More the things change, more they stay the same — will be as true for 2025 as it was for 2024. Only the sameness will be messier as the old world order unravels, and a new order tries to emerge both politically and economically." **~ Hindustan Times**

About 60 countries representing roughly half the world’s population were set to go to the polls in 2024, more than any year in the past. Japan, France, the UK, the US, and, of course, India all held major elections. As many people put it, democracy was on the ballot in 2024.

This meant that day after day, month after month, the average voter was subjected to relentless campaign messaging created by political professionals who — no matter what side they’re on — all share one unshakeable assumption, which is that the average voter has the intellectual depth of a cardboard cutout. It was brutal and felt as though it would never end.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party won a third consecutive victory but were forced into a coalition government this time around, falling short of a majority in parliament after a decade. India’s 2024 general election also made history in two big ways:

1. It saw the highest-ever participation of women voters.
2. It became the longest-running election, stretching over 44 days.

In the United Kingdom, the Labour Party won an overwhelming majority, bringing 14 years of Conservative Party rule to an end. Russia's Vladimir Putin won his fifth presidential election with 87 percent of the vote, the highest-ever result in Russia’s post-Soviet history. South Africa’s national election this year marks the first time the African National Congress, the ruling party since 1994, is unable to win a majority in the National Assembly and has to form a government with other political parties.

But what made this election year even more exciting in terms of sustained idiocy, was America.

Donald Trump emerged victorious in November after defeating Kamala Harris by a comfortable margin. But all that which led to it was absolute drama!

- In Feb, Donald Trump was found guilty on all 34 felony counts related to his hush-money trial.
- He then survived two attempted assassinations.
- The convictions and attempted assasination dealt a fatal blow to Trump's candidacy. Just kidding, they ended up bolstering his popularity even more. 
- In June, Trump and Biden faced off in a much-anticipated prime-time debate: an event originally proposed by the Biden campaign.
- But Biden ended up dropping out of the presidential race after an abysmal performance. He looked like a man who’s trying to remember where he put the remote control, unaware of the fact that he is holding it. 
- Kamala Harris then stepped in as the Democratic nominee, but the momentum had already shifted. And with Elon Musk stepping in as Trump’s right-hand-man, Harris didn’t stand a real chance.
- In Nov, Trump defeated Harris comfortably, securing a chaotic but commanding return to the White House.

#### Erm... what now?

It’s an unnerving exciting time to be alive, as the post-election nations will begin to discover, with varying degrees of excitement, what it voted for. [^1]
