> "You can't say civilization isn't advancing. In every war, they kill you in a new way." **~ Will Rogers**

Let's get one thing straight: this is *not* World War Three, although President Putin does like to dangle that threat to scare the West away from sending weapons to Ukraine. Still, from Ukraine to Gaza, Syria to Sudan, and even Yemen, 2024 slipped into a nonstop series of global dramas — none of which exactly earned the *“Chill Guy”* award.

#### Russia-Ukraine 🇷🇺🇺🇦

The war that has been raging in the east of Europe since 24 February 2022 started when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in a failed bid to take over the whole country. It has been a 1,000 days since and the war has now shown itself as an *almost* certain stalemate. Some kind of messy ceasefire deal may be the least painful of all options for Ukraine, even though it does not trust Putin's word.
#### Gaza‑Lebanon‑Israel-Iran 🇮🇱🇱🇧🇮🇷

Following the horrors of October 7, Gaza saw its most brutal year ever with more civilian suffering than anyone wants to count. It spilled into Lebanon when Israel invaded southern zones, killing hundreds and displacing up to a half‑million  Iran even joined the fireworks mid year with a barrage of missiles and drones. Add all that up? Fifteen months in, much of Gaza lies in ruins.
#### Syria 🇸🇾

Almost no one saw *this* one coming. Not Syria's now-departed President Bashar al-Assad. Nor, it seems, America's multi-billion dollar intelligence community. Yet within a fortnight, a coalition of Islamist rebels (who are designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN) managed to break out of their stronghold in northwest Syria and seize city after city until they have now become Syria's new rulers.
#### Sudan 🇸🇩 

Sudan’s civil war passed its second anniversary in 2024, with nearly *half* the population teetering on famine. In fact, it is also currently the largest displacement crisis in the world amid relentless conflict and humanitarian collapse.

And then there’s Yemen. And Congo. Reminders that some wars don't need headlines to keep taking lives. In 2024, the world didn't erupt. It just kept bleeding... quietly.[^1]
