#### The Year of Lookalike Contests

> In German folklore, *doppelgängers* are considered to be a bad omen 🧿; quite the opposite of how we now seem to enjoy celebrating them.

In late September, mysterious posters started appearing around Manhattan advertising a *'Timothée Chalamet Lookalike Competition'* with a cash prize of $50. But would anyone actually show up? And the answer was a resounding yes. 

Even the *real* Timothée Chalamet made an appearance at his own competition on October 28 to watch the best fake Timmy be crowned. After that, things moved quickly and the idea soon spread to cities around the world: a Harry Styles competition in London, a Zendaya competition in Brooklyn and a Dev Patel one in San Francisco. At a Glen Powell lookalike competition in Austin, the winner was decided by her mother and aunt, with the prize being a cameo in Powell’s next movie.

#### Spolights and Accolades

Christopher Nolan’s *Oppenheimer* ruled the Academy Awards this year, receiving seven Oscars, including for best picture, best actor and best director amongst others. We also had Taylor Swift, who won a record-setting fourth Grammy Award for album of the year for *Midnights*. She also made news with her Eras tour. After 149 shows spanning 21 months, the tour set unprecedented records, making Swift the first artist in history to gross over $2 billion in ticket sales.

Speaking of concerts 🏟️, in May, Madonna thrilled 1.6 million people at a concert in Rio to wrap up her *Celebration* tour. Madonna's concert was the largest standalone concert ever for any artist, male or female. The pop girl duo of Charli XCX and Sabrina Carpenter headlined the rest of the music discussion this year.

#### Moviegoers Embracing the Familiar

> And by '*familiar*,' I mean '*sequels to movies we’ve all already seen, probably more than once.*'

The total box office for the year reached $8.5 billion, exceeding the projection for 2024. That’s the good news. The meh news is that it’s all but due to a lack of originality. 14 of the 15 highest-grossing movies of 2024 were sequels — with only the (Broadway-inspired 🎭) *Wicked* able to make it's own place in the Top 15. Audiences leaned heavily on the comfort of the familiar, with fresh stories struggling to break through.

#### The Drake-Lamar Beef

Initially, things seemed rosy between these two artists when they collaborated on each other’s records during the early stages of their careers. But as time passed, the friendly fire became a volcanic eruption. Current situation: an ongoing lyrical death match 🥊 between the two biggest rappers in the world.

> Feuds are as old as hip-hop itself, and often, they fuel creativity and public personas. This has become one of the most captivating rivalries of recent years and has the potential to continue well into 2025.

#### The Novelty Popcorn Trend

Ordering popcorn 🍿 before a movie used to be a simple thing; paper buckets which were as stable as a late stage Jenga tower. But suddenly, novelty (movie-themed) popcorn buckets were everywhere in 2024, and there was none more famous, or perhaps infamous, than that of *Dune: Part Two*. It even inspired an *SNL* sketch. Shaped like one of the movie’s giant sandworms, the final design ended up looking, erm... like something that reminded everyone just how immature we can be online. 

Since it blew up on the internet, everyone got in on it – the new *Ghostbusters* got ghost traps; *Despicable Me 4* went for a (rather inspired) Minion baby carrier; *Inside Out 2* opted for the vessel shaped like the control module in Ripley’s head... There doesn’t seem to be a blockbuster release without some kind of popcorn-themed merch these days.[^1]
