At the end of every year, some of us like to look back and see where our expectations held up or fell flat, what all happened during the year, and just what the year, considered as a whole, really meant. 

As I started doing this for 2024, it wasn't the sheer realization of *just* how many things happened. Instead, the harder part was figuring out  in a tide of events, which ones will really last five, 10, or even 50 years from now. Which ones to sit with and write about, and which ones to leave behind with a passing mention. Our news cycles through really fast. Nothing stays in the headlines or in the shadows for long — we glide through events, interpret them, misinterpret them, and move on from them.

But memory doesn’t work like that. It doesn't keep pace with the news.

This keeps coming back to me. Because when I think about the year, it’s not the headlines I remember most. It’s a few unexpectedly personal moments that linger. Not every year offers a simple conclusion. Not every year wraps up with a neat message.

And still, every December, I try to write some sort of an ending. But just like every time before, I find myself leaving it unfinished.
