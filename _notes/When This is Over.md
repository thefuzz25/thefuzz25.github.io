There’s this poem that I came across during the pandemic. I even used a part of it in my [2020, in a Nutshell](https://thefuzz25.github.io/ian). Penned by Laura Kelly Fanucci, its essence is still worth living by. Thought I'd share.

> When this is over
> 
> May we never again
> 
> Take for granted
> 
> A handshake with a stranger
> 
> Conversations with the neighbors
> 
> Cutely annoying cousins 
> 
> The boring Tuesdays
> 
> A crowded theatre
> 
> And life itself

Some days, I forget. I rush through mornings, complain about professors or mess food (valid, but still), scroll past sunsets. But then I’ll talk with a friend I hadn’t seen in a while, or take a compliment from a stranger or any of the million other things — and I’ll remember.

We promised ourselves we wouldn’t forget what mattered.

Maybe it’s time to re-promise.
