### Why I picked it up
A couple of reasons:
- I already had the book at home, courtesy of Dad having read it ages ago
- I wanted to get familiar with Mario Puzo's writing before diving into the infamous *Godfather* trilogy.

### How the read went
It started strong: solid world-building and clear POVs. The objective of the book got established quite early on. But the thing is, the book kept circling the same theme over and over. There was nothing more to it. As [this gal](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl) on *Goodreads* put it, 'it was but a profusion of superfluous ancillary characters, and every plot device ever known to writers of political thrillers thrown in.' 

I managed until *Part III* and then skimmed the rest.

### What sits beneath the story
As *Mail on Sunday* puts it:

> 'This book paints a fine satirical portrait of the super-rich oligarchs who pull the strings of political power.' 

And that it does (albeit repetitively). Through a fictional member of the Kennedy dynasty, Puzo does portray how power and manipulation pools at the top and how the rest of the world is at their mercy. With assassinations, terrorism, bombings and dictatorship; this book had it all (which, for me, was a little too much). 

### Should you read it?
I mean, if you are warming up for more Mario Puzo (as was my case), this is fine. But there aren't a lot of exciting moments in there for a standalone read.
