### Why I picked it up

Uhh,
- I had the book at home (got it along with *The Alchemist* a couple years back).
- Seemed thin enough for a quick-y.

### How the read went

Yadayadayada. An over-the-top read because I couldn't care less about the storyline or the characters.

### What sits beneath the story

Nothing much honestly. The main character aka 'Veronika' had no depth to her at all. Uhh, why'd she want to die again? Oh right, everything in her life was steady and boring. From chill parents and a cool job as a librarian to a pretty face and plenty of boys to go around — sure she decides to die by pill overdose 💅🏻. 

Accompanying her in the cast were two others: a doctor who drugged her throughout as an experiment and a schizophrenic whom she inexplicably fell in love with because he fancied her piano-playing-skills.

Moreover, Coelho's rambling about how madness and genius are two sides of a coin 🪙 is utterly nonsensical. Were insane patients  the best way to deliver this to the audience? We might never know. And all this is excluding the author's baseless appearance at the start of the novel.

> The book ends with the overbearing message that we should all stop trying to conform to the expectations of society. But the only person I think ain't conforming to writing good reads (as is the expectation from bestselling authors) is Coelho himself.

### Should you read it?

You needn't.
