### Why I picked it up

Reasons threefold:
- I’d had enough of clean, modern narratives and wanted to return to a classic author.
- Visiting St. Petersburg recently made *Dostoevsky* an obvious pick, since so much of his work is rooted in that city.
- Was up for a challenging novel.

### How the read went

And boy, this was a difficult read. The story revolved around a single character but the way his mind spirals made me feel like I was spiraling with him. The only respite was recognizing the places mentioned in the book thanks to my trip there. And seriously, why the hell do Russians address each other with five different names? One or two would have done the job.

> 'Too often willfully obscure.'

It is a short novel though (about 150 pages) and once I got the hang of everything, it did pull me in. But the latter half was predictable and dragged on longer than it needed to, which is probably why the whole thing stretched into a one-to-two-month read for me.

### What sits beneath the story
At its core, it's about a man losing his sense of self. The book digs into the anxiety of being invisible in society; of how a person can feel erased, overlooked, or dismissed until that pressure creates its own inner monster. The “double” comes off less as a man and more as the embodiment of the main character Golyadkin’s paranoia. The contrast of him slipping into delusion while trying desperately to hold onto routine and dignity works very well. Every interaction of Golyadkin becomes a threat and every glance a conspiracy. And since the entire thing is from his POV, albeit in the third person, the reader is trapped claustrophobically in his panicked and chaotic mindset. 

### Should you read it?

If I were starting fresh with Dostoevsky, I’d probably pick something more well-known, like _Crime and Punishment_ or _The Brothers Karamazov_. But as a short piece to his darker, weirder side, it’s not a bad pick[^1].
