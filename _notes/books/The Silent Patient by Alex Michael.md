### Why I picked it up
Because... coincidence.
- More than one person recommended _The Silent Patient_ to me, more than once, and all within the last month. At some point you just give in.

### How the read went
I quite liked the two-narrator, three-timeline setup the author chose. The diary-entry style of giving context is fairly ordinary, sure, but it does cut out a lot of unnecessary buildup. This puts the readers directly in the aftermath of things, which works well for this particular genre of fiction.

The book kept me hooked throughout: there’s enough variation, movement, and momentum to hold you at bay. The ending was definitely well played, but personally, I found it not as shocking as it was hyped out to be. Alex might have pushed the narrators’ mindset a little more than necessary, which made the reveal slightly leading, for me at least.

To avoid spoilers, just think: Agatha Christie, but with fewer characters, more psychological depth, and a more emotional core.

### What sits beneath the story

At its heart, _The Silent Patient_ is playing with the idea of silence—what it protects, what it hides, and what it forces others to project onto it. It’s a story about trauma, obsession, and the narratives we create for ourselves when the truth feels too heavy or too ugly to confront. The book also nudges you into questioning how much of someone’s personality you can really piece together from the outside, and how dangerous it is when people mistake their interpretations for reality.

### Should you read it?
All in all, I did finish the book in just a couple of days. Maybe it was the hype for the much-talked-about ending or maybe the storytelling is genuinely compelling. Either way, it’s worth picking up.
