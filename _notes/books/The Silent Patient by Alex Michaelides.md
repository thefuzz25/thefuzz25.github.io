### Why I picked it up
Because... coincidence.
- More than one person recommended _The Silent Patient_ to me, more than once, and all within the last month. At some point you just give in.

### How the read went
I quite liked the two-narrator, three-timeline setup the author chose. The diary-entry style of giving context is fairly ordinary, sure, but it does cut out a lot of unnecessary buildup. This puts the readers directly in the aftermath of things, which works well for this particular genre of fiction.

The book kept me hooked throughout: there’s enough variation, movement, and momentum to hold you at bay. The ending was definitely well played, but personally, I found it not as shocking as it was hyped out to be. Alex might have pushed the narrators’ mindset a little more than necessary, which made the reveal slightly leading, for me at least.

To avoid spoilers, just think: Agatha Christie, but with fewer characters, more psychological depth, and a more emotional core.

### What sits beneath the story

The premise plays with the idea of silence:
1. what it hides or protects from others, and
2. what it forces other to project onto it.
For most of the novel, Alex Michaelides pushes us to focus on the first. The story is told through Theo, the narrator and for the most part, I believed him. But as readers, while we're drawn to his version of events, we still crave the truth from Alicia herself. This is what keeps us turning pages.

It's only at the reveal that the second aspect comes into focus. We're forced to revisit the story and realize just how much of our observations were built on projection. It nudges you into questioning how much of someone's personality you can piece together from the outside. You can never really know what it was like to be them in that moment, or why they did what they did.

And then there are also the coping mechanisms that humans invent in the face of tragedy. These mechanisms are, in their own way, another kind of silence — the truth we keep even from ourselves. In that silence, we create narratives that soften or distort reality when it feels too heavy or too ugly to confront.

> All psychological novels eventually circle such ideas, but they still prompt you to think every time you pick them up.

### Should you read it?
All in all, I did finish the book in just a couple of days. Maybe it was the hype for the much-talked-about ending or maybe the storytelling is genuinely compelling. Either way, it’s worth picking up.
