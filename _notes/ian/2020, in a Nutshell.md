### Preface

Welcome 2021! Yes, I know that no year can beat 2020 in terms of exuberance, excitement and ambience. But still I hope that the coming year makes life worth living again (after a bit of turbulence named the Coronavirus). 

Anyways, getting back to the theme of this article; 2020 is surely an year to be remembered. I mean, we all enjoyed it, right? Right??? (Just exclude the whole lockdown scenario, pandemic, economic crisis and our new boring lifestyle, then you can’t help but admire the beauty of the past 366 days.)

In this chronicle, I’ll sum up the highlights of the glorious year 2020 and give my thoughts on the coming year of change and how to adjust to the new normal.
