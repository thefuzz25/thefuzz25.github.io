### Preface

Everything feels new, unbelievable, overwhelming. At the same time, it feels as if we’ve walked back two years in our lives and are finally back to how things were. In a way, we have. We knew roughly exactly what it would be like, but somehow this makes the encounter not less fascinating, but more so.

We all experienced loads of ‘Long time no see!’  greetings this year. Not to mention the awkward hugs; the cubicle-to-cubicle chatter; and those perplexing, horrible introductions to the friends of your friends. 

In the beginning, there was some concern that 2022 would scrimp on the number of shocks and outrages it’d provide us, coming as it did on the heels of a pretty awesome 2021.  But we needn’t have worried… 

In this chronicle, let’s revisit and review the highlights of the tumultuous year 2022!
