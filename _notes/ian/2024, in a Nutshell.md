### Preface

2024 was like the classic middle child of a family. Not flashy, not disastrous, just...there. But hey, while the past year flew by, a lot did happen in that time.  And by a lot, I mean quite interesting stuff. Sometimes I feel like I get to know more about the world I'm living in, in the prep of this year-in-review, than I do living it. For instance, did you know a couple of astronauts took a week-long trip to the International Space Station in June of '24, and now they’re stuck there? Yep, they’re due back next March because of some equipment issues. Talk about an extended layover with no extra baggage allowance.

Now let's get right into what went down this year on Planet Earth, as I present to you '2024, in a Nutshell', the fifth of the series (honestly DID NOT think I'd make it this far).
