My blog has for so long been all sermons and truths. I haven't really written as much fiction as I would have liked to. Here's one for y'all.

You know that feeling? Where worry nags you so much that you forget what you're worrying about in the first place. Waiting rooms are the epitome for this; be it airport lounges, parent teacher meetings (as a parent of a 15-year-old, *not* as a student), interviews, or as was one of my highlights of last week, a dentist appointment. If you rolled your eyes on my plight just now, I sure hope you end up with a root canal really soon.

Let's start again. I'm Andrew, a historian in the great German city of Berlin. Between the two of us, I really don't find it great at all but I've had to shift here and faking acceptance is I think the only way to numb my misfortune. But that's a story for another day. Let me rather begin the tale for which you're here, having already read more than you have the entire last week I'm sure.

It was a Tuesday. I was already tired from the many grueling days of work this week ( one, but still exhausting). I remembered I have a spare medical leave and also it was just too cozy in bed, so I called in sick on the pretext of a tooth ache. Now one of the things I don't like about Berlin is that it's in Germany. And it is very difficult to know when a German is joking and when he isn't. Just like when my boss told me on the call that we share the same dentist so he'll check in on me. 

So now I have to get out of bed and head to the dentist's office for a prescription to get some ice cream on the way home (for my teeth of course).  So much for being a smart-ass.

A cup of coffee, a shower and a drive later, I checked in with the receptionist (whose teeth I could literally count by the way of how many times she smiled at me). Then I entered the waiting room. 

You remember the feeling I described earlier? It hit me the first time since I thought the interviewer was going to order me to dance to *Rasputin* because my CV mentioned I was interested in World War 1 and the Russian Revolution. The waiting room seemed like any other. At first that is. There was the door through which I entered, a door to the dentist's room across the room, frosted windows on my left along with a painting of some german lore I couldn't care less about.

There were four other people in the room and each of them looked like they cared as much about the painting as I did.

None of them spoke. Which, ordinarily, I would have appreciated.

Silence and I have always had a comfortable understanding. As a historian, most of what I work with is silence. Pages that stop mid-sentence. People who never explained themselves. Silence, in my experience, is not empty. It listens. It keeps things.

But this silence was different. This silence was not listening. It was whispering back. 
In the way that the air seemed cloudy. In the way every small movement felt acknowledged. Somewhat similar to the time I dreamt of being on reality tv.

It was the kind of silence that made you aware of yourself from the outside. And I did not like it.
