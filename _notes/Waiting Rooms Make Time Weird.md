> My blog has for so long been all sermons and truths. I haven't really written as much fiction as I would have liked to. Here's one for y'all.

You know that feeling? Where worry nags you so much that you forget what you're worrying about in the first place. Waiting rooms are the epitome for this; be it airport lounges, parent teacher meetings (as a parent of a 15-year-old, *not* as a student), interviews, or as was one of my highlights of last week, a dentist 🦷 appointment. If you rolled your eyes on my plight just now, I sure hope you end up with a root canal really soon.

Let's start again. I'm Andrew, a historian in the great German city of *Berlin*. Between the two of us, I really don't find it great at all but I've had to shift here and faking acceptance is I think the only way to numb my misfortune. But that's a story for another day. Let me rather begin the tale for which you're here, having already read more than you would have in the entire week I'm sure.

It was a Tuesday and I was tired from the many grueling days of work this week (one, but still exhausting). I remembered I have a spare medical leave day 📅 and also it was just too cozy in bed, so I called in sick on the pretext of a tooth ache. Now one of the things I don't like about Berlin is that it's in Germany. And it is very difficult to know when a German is joking and when he isn't. Just like when my boss told me on the call that we share the same dentist so he'll check in on me later in the day 😑. 

So now I had to get out of bed and head to the dentist's office, all for a prescription to get some ice cream on the way home (for my tooth ache of course). So much for being a smart-ass.

A cup of coffee, a shower and a drive later, I stepped out from the car. Outside, a construction worker across the street was engaged in a deeply personal argument with the ground. His drill screamed in protest as it bit into the concrete. I headed into the building, and checked in with the receptionist (whose teeth I literally could count by the way of how many times she smiled at me). Then I entered the waiting room. 

You remember the feeling I described earlier? It hit me the first time since I thought my last interviewer was going to order me to dance 🕺🏽 to *Rasputin* because my CV mentioned I was interested in World War 1 and the Russian Revolution. The waiting room seemed like any other at first. There was the door through which I entered, a door to the dentist's room across the hall, frosted windows on my left along with a painting of some german village I couldn't *care* less about on the remaining wall.

---

There were three other people in the room and each of them looked like they cared as much about it as I did. 

Closest to the door sat a man in grey suit that had seen better decades. Not years, decades. The fabric shone faintly at the elbows, the way things do when they've been leaned on too often. His hands rested on his knees, palms down.

Across from him was a woman who could have been anywhere between thirty and a school math teacher. She held her phone upright but hadn't moved her thumb in several seconds.

The last was a boy, or perhaps a young man pretending not to be one anymore. He sat slouched forward, elbows on knees, staring at the floor with intense suspicion. A few moments was he still and the rest of the time, his foot tapped absent-mindedly.

---

None of them spoke. Which, ordinarily, I would have appreciated.

Silence and I have always had a comfortable understanding. As a historian, most of what I work with is silence. Pages that stop mid-sentence. People who never explained themselves. Silence, in my experience, is not empty. It listens. It keeps things.

But this silence was different. This silence was not listening. It was whispering back. 
In the way that the air seemed hazy. In the way every small movement felt acknowledged. Somewhat similar to the time I dreamt of being on *reality TV* 📺.

It was the kind of silence that made you aware of yourself from the outside. And I did not like it.

---

The first thing to happen since I sat down was the old man checking his watch. Not urgently. Just to confirm that time had not escaped without informing him. The woman’s phone vibrated briefly in her hand. She looked at it and sighed 😮‍💨 in a way as if a student had started each line of the answer sheet with the *'therefore'* symbol. The boy’s foot continued its quiet negotiation with the floor.

Then, from behind the dentist’s door, came the sound. The sound whose purpose was universally understood and universally resented.

It was faint. But unmistakable. It was a thin, electric whine that rose and held its place in the air with professional confidence. The drill.

I found myself looking at the painting 🖼️, and recognized the style as vaguely *historical*, which was unfortunate. It meant I was expected to care. The scene was calm, not tropical but the kind before a storm. Like something bad was about to go *down*. The only figure was a young kid with an indistinguishable expression. The drill stopped shortly.

I was just about finished with one horror (the painting), when I heard another. That moment, a child cried from inside the room. Honestly, it might have been a chirp but the painting had me visualizing stuff now.

The boy’s foot stopped tapping. The old man did not look at the door, but he did not look away from it either. 

Then, as if satisfied, the drill resumed. The sound felt familiar in a way I could not immediately place. This annoyed me. I prefer my discomforts to be properly categorized.

---

The woman’s phone rang. The sound was abrupt. Too loud for the room. I was glad for the distraction but she apparently wasn't. She answered quickly.

> “Yes,” she said, quietly.
> 
> Pause.
> 
> “I told you, I’m at the dentist.”
> 
> Another pause. Her jaw tightened slightly.
> 
> “I’ll call you back.”

She ended the call and returned the phone to her lap, where it remained, face down, like something temporarily in detention. 

No one acknowledged it, but the interruption had consequences. We all now had to find new things to avoid dreading our turns. The boy’s eyes had drifted upwards towards the painting. The old man checked his watch again. This time, he held it there longer, as though waiting for permission to stop looking. I could have swore an hour must have passed since I came in. But the clock showed only fifteen. This seemed incorrect but more than that, this was insulting.

The drill stopped again and I found myself looking at the door 🚪 without deciding to do so. It remained closed. Entirely ordinary. Entirely uninterested in being observed.

The boy resumed tapping his foot, though slower now, as if uncertain of the tempo. The woman adjusted her grip on her phone without unlocking it. I realized that all of us were trying to listen to the silence. Listening as one listens to weather. Not expecting it to change, but still waiting to see if it would.

---

The door opened briefly. 

> “Herr Müller,” a voice called. 

The old man stood with quiet obedience and disappeared inside. The door closed behind him but the drill did not begin immediately. This, for reasons I could not justify, troubled me more than if it had.

We waited again. I glanced upwards again. And the more I thought about the painting, the more I envied it. It had watched people wait before. It would watch people wait again. It had the advantage of permanence. We were just biding our time.

And I became aware of myself sitting there. Of my hands. Of my breathing. Of my growling stomach. Of the fact that a few skipped lunches might actually leave me better off. 

---

The next time I looked up, I was the only one left in the waiting room. I looked about in disbelief and turns out that wasn't the case. It was me and the kid in the frame. Also the drill had returned.  

The ticking clock had committed itself to its own *Never-ending Story*. What felt like days was apparently an hour. Finally, I heard the dentist call:

> “Andrew?”

And as I got up with an enthusiasm which I did not feel, I glanced at the painting one last time. This time though, I understood the expression of the boy. He was smug 😏 in the *'I-might-have-a-storm-coming-my-way-but-you're-gonna-have-it-much-worse'* way. 

Lucky him.

Somewhere outside, the drilling continued with tireless conviction. It occurred to me then just how much I hated that construction guy 👷🏻.

And still... I could not remember which tooth had brought me there in the first place.
