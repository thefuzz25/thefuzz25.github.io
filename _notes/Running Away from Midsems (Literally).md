### What Actually Went Down

**Prior:** The midsems are to begin tomorrow and I have a questionable plan. But before you label me a ~~genius~~ lunatic , hear me out — KGP's annual 20K campus run is coming up right after exams. Soooooo, in order to get some miles in, I’m planning to run a 5K after every paper. Because why not? It'll give me a much needed outlet for the mental frustration in addition to the physical preparation to go back to the desk and study. Well, that's the idea. Let's see how it goes 🤞🏻. 

**During:** Some people like to reevaluate the paper after it’s over, but this week, you’ll find me quite literally trying to outrun it.

**Post:** The 5K runs went according to the plan (the midsems? Not so much). And while the actual running is, well, done; the  concept of all of it got me thinking.

### My Musings

> Exercise is the quiet rebellion of the body against the clutter of the mind; a dance of liberation.

And liberation it was indeed. All my papers were 2-4pm and it became a routine to just get back to the room, drop my bag, put on the shoes and set off. The predictability of all of it within such a short time was what really intrigued me. I do workout regularly but boy, never have I looked forward to it as I did this past week or so. On the runs themselves, I was able to look back and plan ahead. I might not have had a proper study strategy, but the commitment to get on with it? That, I had — before I was back at my desk 📚 each evening.

### My Takeaways

Maybe it's not just about running or exams. Maybe it's about finding those tiny rituals that keep us sane. This one just happened to be mine. Did it bring me the perfect balance between physical exhaustion and mental clarity? Debatable 🧐. But I did find an oddly specific way to procrastinate. So there’s that.
