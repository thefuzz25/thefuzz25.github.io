## Live Journal

Big words, the right mood and some semblance of sanity are rare; in college, even more so. Just watched _The Social Network_, and now I'm starting a live journal. No reason. Just felt like it.

I met an uncle at the gym today. But before I get to that, let me set the scene. The gym’s in the cantonment, so about 99% of the people there are army officers — some at the peak of their physical abilities, others well past it, but impressive regardless. And then there’s the remaining 1%, which is more or less just me.

Back to today’s encounter. This guy walked in drenched in sweat, 10 kg dumbbells in each hand. Did 20 pull-ups, a hundred-something squats, threw in a some more random exercises, and called it a day. As we got talking (me mostly in awe), he said he likes to surprise his body every day. Some evenings, even he doesn’t know what he’s going to do next.

Now, whether or not that approach is the most efficient (or even recommended) is debatable. But it got me thinking. Is it really worth obsessing over tracking apps, rigid routines, and self-imposed deadlines for gains? Improvement is a perpetual process. Maybe it’s meant to be lived and enjoyed, not constantly measured and pushed around.

For much of last year, I’ve been trying to become more *efficient*, more *capable*.  But perhaps the latter is not totally dependent on the former.

Something felt unsettling the past few days. I couldn't it point out then, but it lingered at the back of my mind. Now I realize it was the book 'The Silent Patient', in particular the two main characters. Everything about them screamed the frailty of the human mind and how disturbed all of us really are, if only we were to look inside. 

I found myself looking back on some of my not-so-pleasant memories. And it put me off balance, even after all this time. But the memories themselves weren’t the real problem. It was the mindset the book pushed: the insistence that our minds are fragile things waiting to crack. That’s what made me feel weaker than I am.

And I don’t agree with that. Deep down, my belief is this: the mind is only as tough, or as weak, as you decide to make it. In the end, it’s still you versus whatever you’re carrying.

It feels strange to make this LiveJournal public, but that is precisely why I began it: to learn to stand by my thoughts with a little more confidence.

Another semester draws to a close. I returned home a few days ago but hey, you know how the first week back after every sem is like (think: food, tv and sleep)

Reaching this point marks a milestone: I am now halfway through my college life. And while I have achieved a lot in that time, **something** still feels off. **I** feel off. So I intend for this winter to serve inwards. A pause. A deliberate look within.

Lately, a lot of people have been complimenting me on my dressing sense. It’s nice, of course; nothing to lean too much into. But the thing is, I haven’t actually changed anything from past semesters, or even before that. What I _have_ changed, now that I think about it, is how I take care of myself — my posture, workouts, and self-care in general. These things don’t pay off in obvious ways, but they do, quietly. And they keep on giving.
#### Sun, 08 Nov 2025 — 14:09
For the past couple of months or so, I've start consuming a lot more literature and news. And it felt, like, really good not to let your life subconsciously revolve around classes and gym and all the regular college activities. That was the initial motive, yes. But it slowly started growing on me more that I thought it would. That, and the fact that I always considered myself a *Jack* as in *a jack of all trades but a master of none*. I've been reading more into this and recently found a quirky little analogy about Jacks and Polymaths, and I think this is the right time for me to go down that route. Another factor that ties to it is me craving intellectual discussions (something which is a total no go right now in my circle). A very very far-off objective is to start a Dead Poets Society-esque thingy here on campus. A really ambitious project so should absolutely think this through.

#### Sun, 02 Nov 2025 — 22:37
Goddammit man. Everyone's playing sports and running 5Ks and stuff. And then there is this guy (me) who's going to physio six days a week. Last few days, I thought that this hiatus might actually be a blessing in disguise. In the sense that I can put my energy into other more productive (erm, academically inclined) activities. But while that is true, I feel more like an old unc in rehab, watching the new generation proudly play and run around.

Things still aren't clear. Technically, I might have no work done today. And if not for the principle of exclusion, I would have believed that too. But I have considerably narrowed down the field I wish to pursue. One thing is for sure as ever, that I do not want to rush this decision. This upcoming week, I intend to talk to a few alums and figure out a roadmap. Then the only thing left would be to revv my engines for the race to come.

#### Sun, 19 Oct 2025 — 19:15
It is night already and I noticed just yet, that I haven't spoken a single word today (apart from a short phone call to dad). And the thing to note is, that I did not, for one moment, feel to need to. I know that humans are supposed to be social beings but sometimes you just need to sit in solitude and think. Where you at, what you wanna do and how are you gonna do just that. I don't have all the answers at the end of the day. But what I do have, is a start.

I know there’s something wrong with my left knee. There has been for three years now. But _what_ exactly is wrong — no one can figure that out. And that uncertainty gnaws at me more than the pain itself.

This is what each one of my several hospital visits have looked like:

> Me: Hi, I’m here to get my knee checked.  
> Doctor: Ah, yes. Let’s get some tests done. X-rays, MRI, bloodwork — the usual.  
> (Several hours and a small fortune later.)  
> Doctor: Nothing’s wrong, kiddo. You’re fine.  
> Me: So I can play again?  
> Doctor: No, no. Don’t do anything more than walk. Rest and recover.  
> Me: But why?  
> Doctor: Because of the injury.  
> Me: What injury? You just said I’m fine.  
> Doctor: That you are.

And that’s that.

This is it. This is life. A sudden realization, sure, but a welcome one at that. Yes, I want to play the long game. Yes, I want to see results. Yes, I want success. But, somewhere along the way, I forgot to smile.
Today, I did. Truly. After a long time. And for that, I have my sister to thank. Just listening her chatter about college life all bubbly and breathless — after a tough few months settling in — warmed something in me I didn't know had gone cold. 
Ambition is a funny thing: let's not take it too seriously.

#### Sun, 10 Oct 2025 — 15:56
Everyone is busy pretending to be more than they actually are. But, I mean, like, WHY. This has started to annoy me so much more now since I've learnt to see through it.

#### Thu, 09 Oct 2025 — 19:39

Just when everything starts settling down, doth it thunder. I finally got a diagnosis for my lower back — turns out I’ve a small disc herniation.

- The upside: it’s still in the onset phase and can be fixed with core strengthening.
- The downside: there aren’t many core exercises one can _actually_ do in this situation. Like, what the heck. How on earth am I supposed to recover with only planks and freakin' cat-cows? A mockery, really. To heal, I must bend without bending.

#### Mon, 06 Oct 2025 — 16:07
Man, this past week at home flew right by. Between eating, sleeping, and doing absolutely nothing, I got no work done whatsoever. Not that I care though, it was totally worth it.  
But now I’m back on campus, relaxed plenty, and ready to get started!
#### Sat, 27 Sep 2025 — 21:09

Travel is a b****** . Although the thought of going back home does take away some exhaustion from it.

> “Fear is the mind-killer.” ~ Frank Herbert

The mid-semesters start two days from now, and the key thing to note is this: I’m not afraid of them this time. _I’m bored_.

Yes, yes, some of you will say that exams shouldn’t be feared. But that isn’t what I mean. I mean the air — that tension that usually hangs around a person during papers. It’s gone. And not because I’m well-prepared (I’m _not_, before you ask). Whatever the reason for this might be, boredom cleared my mind in a way fear never can.

Had a test today, one tomorrow, and another the day after. An assignemt submission yesterday, two more tomorrow. Sure, it’s easy to be overwhelmed — but I’ve been through worse.

#### Sun, 07 Sep 2025 — 14:30

We often forget how powerful a routine is. A to-do list feels icy, but a plan makes the day flow — and somehow you end up getting more done than you thought. The library has helped me with this, mostly because I don’t trust my self-discipline much (I have some, I guess, so don’t take whatever I write too seriously).

Another big shift has been in how I use my free time. I’ve gone from YouTube and reels to documentaries, articles, and _Go_. (I’ll write on that newfound interest some other day.) It makes a world of difference, and half the time, you don’t even notice it happening.

#### Sun, 07 Sep 2025 — 06:10

Today’s James Clear newsletter asked: 

> _Who are you afraid of disappointing, and how would your choices change if you released that fear?_

But I think the opposite. Maybe it’s the fear of disappointing that creates expectations — and I find expectations, well, quite healthy. If I released that fear, maybe I’d make bolder choices, but I’m not sure they’d be better ones. Sometimes it’s the quiet weight of expectation keeps you from drifting too far off.

#### Fri, 05 Sep 2025 — 20:28

It’s _crazy_, the feeling of betrayal is. You read about it in books, watch it in movies — but experiencing it firsthand, is another thing altogether. To know someone for so long and then realize they’ve been eating at you the whole time… I don’t even know what to say.

I’d felt the dread building, and now it’s consumed me whole. Getting back up has always been doable, but this time I’m not sure I can. And that scares me.

_PS: Things like this are what prompt real change. I was always a bit cold inside and now I’m colder still._

#### Tue, 02 Sep 2025 — 09:39

You don’t notice it at first, but in college life, one of the few constants is family. No matter what happens in the day, a call home is all you need to get back up. For me right now, that isn’t the case. Between sickness, beginnings, and ends — everything feels scattered.

#### Sat, 30 Aug 2025 — 06:52

Q: Comparison ____ personality.

a) kills

b) fuels

*I’d been subconsciously leaning towards option a) lately and I didn’t even realize it. It’s time to circle b).

> “Man is condemned to be free.” ~ Jean-Paul Sartre

Freedom is weird, man. I waved off all my commitments for the year — no socs, no squash captaincy, no nothing. You’d think that would feel free, but at first I felt trapped. Though you know what, I’m slowly coming to terms with it and it’s letting up.

#### Wed, 20 Aug 2025 — 00:55

Need to work harder. I have been marinating for long enough now; it’s time to actually throw myself on the grill.

#### Mon, 18 Aug 2025 — 19:50

Played squash today after a long break (probably 3+ months). Just about a half an hour, and I was alone — but something about it felt electric. Maybe it’s one of the things I’ve been missing lately. I thought about it, still can’t quite place it. But it sure does hint that I shouldn’t leave sports altogether.

#### Sun, 17 Aug 2025 — 00:21

Have I found myself yet? No. Am I at least on the right track? Still no. But I feel fuller and I will absolutely take that as a win.

_PS:_ Thanks Yuan, my Chinese friend for sharing this awesome proverb a while back —

> “A little fullness is better than perfect completeness.”

#### Thu, 14 Aug 2025 — 02:38

Feeling much better now that I’m both mentally and physically exhausted for the time being. ‘night.

#### Thu, 14 Aug 2025 — 02:12

I think more than anything, it’s this weather that’s driving me insane. You walk, you sweat. You sleep, you sweat. I got so fed up on my stroll earlier that I thought,

> “You wanna sweat? FINE, I’ll make you sweat.”

And then ran a 5K out of pure spite.

#### Thu, 14 Aug 2025 — 01:34

I desperately want to connect with someone like me. But there’s no one even remotely close. No offence to anyone reading this, but I’m different. I don’t do small talk. I adapt myself to the person I’m with and the situation I’m in. I just want to be myself and not be alone for once. Is that too much to ask?

#### Thu, 14 Aug 2025 — 01:28

I’ve definitely gotten better at making decisions over the past few months — but also more impulsive, I think. Is that good though or does it take away from the level headedness that humans uphold so dearly?

#### Mon, 11 Aug 2025 — 18:21

Even in our third year, we keep piling responsibilities onto ourselves as if they’re burdens we must bear. Maybe that’s part of the freshman and sophomore life. But grow up people. Loosen up a bit.

#### Sun, 10 Aug 2025 — 23:19

I should check in with people more. A random call to an old friend had both of us surprised but it felt nice to just talk and not worry.

> “Gravity, stay the hell away from me” ~ _John Mayer_

Sundays are meant to be productive. Can someone please remind me of that sometime?

#### Fri, 08 Aug 2025 — 19:03

UPDATE: Perhaps, a buzz cut wasn’t the best way to vent it out. But whatever man.

#### Fri, 08 Aug 2025 — 14:37

Feeling awfully tired this week; I guess the prolonged travel from St. Pete got to me. The amount of work I have got piled up is beyond obscene. And then there are the labs to compensate as well. My my…

Ok maybe I just need a therapeutic outlet to vent it out. HAIRCUT TIME!
