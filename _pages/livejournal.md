## Live Journal

Big words, the right mood and some semblance of sanity are rare; in college, even more so. Just watched _The Social Network_, and now I'm starting a live journal. No reason. Just felt like it.

Just when everything starts going absolutely great, doth it thunder. I finally got a diagnosis for my lower back — turns out I’m _flexion intolerant_ with a minor L4-L5 disc herniation.

- The upside: it’s still in the onset phase and can be fixed with core strengthening.
- The downside: there aren’t many core exercises one can _actually_ do in this situation. Like, what the heck. How on earth am I supposed to recover with only planks and freakin’ cat-cows?

A mockery, really. To heal, I must bend without bending.

Man, this past week at home flew right by. Between eating, sleeping, and doing absolutely nothing, I got no work done whatsoever. Not that I care though, it was totally worth it.

But now I’m back on campus, relaxed plenty, and ready to get started!

I know there’s something wrong with my left knee. There has been for three years now. But _what_ exactly is wrong, no one can figure that out. And that uncertainty gnaws at me more than the pain itself.

This is what each one of my several hospital visits have looked like:

> Me: Hi, I’m here to get my knee checked.  
> Doctor: Ah, yes. Let’s get some tests done. X-rays, MRI, bloodwork — the usual.  
> (Several hours and a small fortune later.)  
> Doctor: Nothing’s wrong, kiddo. You’re fine.  
> Me: So I can play again?  
> Doctor: No, no. Don’t do nothing more than walk. Rest and recover.  
> Me: But why?  
> Doctor: Because of the injury.  
> Me: What injury? You just said I’m fine.  
> Doctor: That you are.

And that’s that.

Travel is a b**** . Although the thought of going back home does take away some exhaustion from it.

> “Fear is the mind-killer.” ~ Frank Herbert

The mid-semesters start two days from now, and the key thing to note is this: I’m not afraid of them this time. _I’m bored_.

Yes, yes, some of you will say that exams shouldn’t be feared. But that isn’t what I mean. I mean the air — that tension that usually hangs around a person during papers. It’s gone. And not because I’m well-prepared (I’m _not_, before you ask). Whatever the reason for this might be, boredom cleared my mind in a way fear never can.

Had a test today, one tomorrow, and another the day after. An assignemt submission yesterday, two more tomorrow. Sure, it’s easy to be overwhelmed — but I’ve been through worse.

#### Sun, 07 Sep 2025 — 14:30

We often forget how powerful a routine is. A to-do list feels icy, but a plan makes the day flow — and somehow you end up getting more done than you thought. The library has helped me with this, mostly because I don’t trust my self-discipline much (I have some, I guess, so don’t take whatever I write too seriously).

Another big shift has been in how I use my free time. I’ve gone from YouTube and reels to documentaries, articles, and _Go_. (I’ll write on that newfound interest some other day.) It makes a world of difference, and half the time, you don’t even notice it happening.

Today’s James Clear newsletter asked: 

> _Who are you afraid of disappointing, and how would your choices change if you released that fear?_

But I think the opposite. Maybe it’s the fear of disappointing that creates expectations — and I find expectations, well, quite healthy. If I released that fear, maybe I’d make bolder choices, but I’m not sure they’d be better ones. Sometimes it’s the quiet weight of expectation keeps you from drifting too far off.

It’s _crazy_, the feeling of betrayal is. You read about it in books, watch it in movies — but experiencing it firsthand, is another thing altogether. To know someone for so long and then realize they’ve been eating at you the whole time… I don’t even know what to say.

I’d felt the dread building, and now it’s consumed me whole. Getting back up has always been doable, but this time I’m not sure I can. And that scares me.

_PS: Things like this are what prompt real change. I was always a bit cold inside and now I’m colder still._

You don’t notice it at first, but in college life, one of the few constants is family. No matter what happens in the day, a call home is all you need to get back up. For me right now, that isn’t the case. Between sickness, beginnings, and ends — everything feels scattered.

Q: Comparison ____ personality.

a) kills

b) fuels

*I’d been subconsciously leaning towards option a) lately and I didn’t even realize it. It’s time to circle b).

> “Man is condemned to be free.” ~ Jean-Paul Sartre

Freedom is weird, man. I waved off all my commitments for the year — no socs, no squash captaincy, no nothing. You’d think that would feel free, but at first I felt trapped. Though you know what, I’m slowly coming to terms with it and it’s letting up.

#### Wed, 20 Aug 2025 — 00:55

Need to work harder. I have been marinating for long enough now; it’s time to actually throw myself on the grill.

#### Mon, 18 Aug 2025 — 19:50

Played squash today after a long break (probably 3+ months). Just about a half an hour, and I was alone — but something about it felt electric. Maybe it’s one of the things I’ve been missing lately. I thought about it, still can’t quite place it. But it sure does hint that I shouldn’t leave sports altogether.

#### Sun, 17 Aug 2025 — 00:21

Have I found myself yet? No. Am I at least on the right track? Still no. But I feel fuller and I will absolutely take that as a win.

_PS:_ Thanks Yuan, my Chinese friend for sharing this awesome proverb a while back —

> “A little fullness is better than perfect completeness.”

#### Thu, 14 Aug 2025 — 02:38

Feeling much better now that I’m both mentally and physically exhausted for the time being. ‘night.

#### Thu, 14 Aug 2025 — 02:12

I think more than anything, it’s this weather that’s driving me insane. You walk, you sweat. You sleep, you sweat. I got so fed up on my stroll earlier that I thought,

> “You wanna sweat? FINE, I’ll make you sweat.”

And then ran a 5K out of pure spite.

#### Thu, 14 Aug 2025 — 01:34

I desperately want to connect with someone like me. But there’s no one even remotely close. No offence to anyone reading this, but I’m different. I don’t do small talk. I adapt myself to the person I’m with and the situation I’m in. I just want to be myself and not be alone for once. Is that too much to ask?

#### Thu, 14 Aug 2025 — 01:28

I’ve definitely gotten better at making decisions over the past few months — but also more impulsive, I think. Is that good though or does it take away from the level headedness that humans uphold so dearly?

#### Mon, 11 Aug 2025 — 18:21

Even in our third year, we keep piling responsibilities onto ourselves as if they’re burdens we must bear. Maybe that’s part of the freshman and sophomore life. But grow up people. Loosen up a bit.

#### Sun, 10 Aug 2025 — 23:19

I should check in with people more. A random call to an old friend had both of us surprised but it felt nice to just talk and not worry.

> “Gravity, stay the hell away from me” ~ _John Mayer_

Sundays are meant to be productive. Can someone please remind me of that sometime?

#### Fri, 08 Aug 2025 — 19:03

UPDATE: Perhaps, a buzz cut wasn’t the best way to vent it out. But whatever man.

#### Fri, 08 Aug 2025 — 14:37

Feeling awfully tired this week; I guess the prolonged travel from St. Pete got to me. The amount of work I have got piled up is beyond obscene. And then there are the labs to compensate as well. My my…

Ok maybe I just need a therapeutic outlet to vent it out. HAIRCUT TIME!
