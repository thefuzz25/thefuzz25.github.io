### About me 

<mark>I’m Faiz.</mark> Depending on when and where you met me, I’m either a student, an artist, or an athlete. This venture of mine is mostly an attempt to keep track of things before they disappear. A few links to explore:

- **[[archive|Writing]]**
- **Projects**
	- [[ian|In a Nutshell]]
	- [[bookshelf|Bookshelf]]
	- [[livejournal|Live Journal]]
- **[[scribbles|Scribbles]]**

### Colophon

This site is written and edited in Obsidian, then compiled with Jekyll and served through GitHub Pages.

The above workflow takes inspiration from [Steph](https://stephango.com/vault) while the design uses a template by [Max](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll), which I’m shaping as I go.
