### Colophon

This site is written and edited in Obsidian, then compiled with Jekyll and served through GitHub Pages.

This workflow takes inspiration from [Steph](https://stephango.com/vault) while the design uses a template by [Max](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll), which I’m shaping as I go.
