Faiz Zaidi is a college student and amateur artist who’s work flirts with both sketches 🎨 and words 🖋️. When not behind a desk, he’s an avid reader and athlete.

He was born in Dehradun, in 2005 and has since revolved around the Sun 19 times. As the son of an Olive Green, he has wheels on his feet, and his home is always spinning around. This has led him to live in 8 cities (so far), attend over 10 schools, and experience _more_ welcomes and goodbyes than most would find necessary.

Currently, he is a sophomore at IIT Kharagpur, pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Manufacturing Science and Engineering. Beyond academics, he has a knack for coding, squash, and all things creative.

<ins>Fun fact</ins>: Faiz does love rain 🌧️ _per se_ but he’d much rather enjoy it from the comfort of home, sitting by a glass window with a steaming cup of coffee ☕️ in hand.
