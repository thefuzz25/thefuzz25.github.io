### Why I picked it up
Uhh,

### How the read went

### What sits beneath the story

### Should you read it?

[^1]: I know I said that, but ended up picking up yet another [[The Day of the Jackal by Frederick Forsyth|political thriller]] akin to my [[The Fourth K by Mario Puzo|previous one]] by Mario Puzo
